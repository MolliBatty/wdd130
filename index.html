            <p>My degree is Web Design and Development, and hope to find a remote job building websites.
            Some things I like to do is bird watch, paint, doodle, and cake decorate. I have been cake decorating and bird watching since 2020.
            I am married, and have been married since April 19th, 2024.</p>
            <p>I am hoping to learn in this class new code like we are now, and how I can use my degree for my future!
            I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my entire life. My favorite scripture is D+C 31:13.
            I'm excited to be in this class!</p>
